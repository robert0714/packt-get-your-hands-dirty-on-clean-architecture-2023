# Chapter 2 Inverting Dependencies
After the rant about layered architecture in the previous chapter, you are right to expect this chapter to discuss an alternative approach. We will start by discussing the Single Responsibility Principle and the Dependency Inversion Principle. They are the "S" and the "D" of the SOLID principles, which you can read about in detail in "Clean Architecture" by Robert C. Martin or on Wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID).
